# Cybersecurity-Builds
Script and Diagrams

This Repository contains content I created at the UCSD Cyber-Security Bootcamp. 
This contains my first Liniux scripts.
It also contains my first Ansible playbooks / Ansible .yml files.
There is also a Diagram, created using draw.io, of a virtual network I created using Azure.
